# LSTM
LSTM network for ETH and BTC price prediction using binance price history

This is a short example for a LSTM network built using Keras running TesnsorFLow backend

It's made in Google Colaboratory so you can just copy paste it into your own colab notebook and check how it works

As I'm using this to learn Keras the document is not actually usefull for price prediction it's just an example on how to build an LSTM network.
